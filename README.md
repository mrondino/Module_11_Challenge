Project Title: Module 11 Challenge

Description: These codes scrape two different websites. The second code creates a dataframe from a website's table and makes visuals from the dataframe. 

File Structure: The codes contain scripts that scrape information from websites using html. The second code outputs a csv file of the dataframe.

Code Source: I utilized the code from Class 11_3 Activity 04-Stu_News to assist with my loop to scrape the headers from the Mars website. I utilized the code from Class 11_3 Activity 03-Stu_Scrape_Book_Links to code the splinter automated navigation portion.
